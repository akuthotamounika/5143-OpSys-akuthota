##1. What does it mean to preempt a process? 

To take a resource away from a process. One such resource is the CPU, and in fact preempt often means to move a process from running state to ready state. The process involuntarily gives up the CPU.  

##2.What is swapping and what is its purpose? 
Swapping means  , we swap a process from the ready state to the ready suspend state that is it gives its memory to another process, in order to maximize the number of processes in the system.

##3.List three general categories of information in a process control block. 
The three general categories of information in  a process control block are:

•	 Process identification data

•	Process state data

•	Process control data

##4.Why are two modes (user and kernel) needed? 
In kernel mode, the CPU has instructions to manage memory and how it can be accessed, plus the ability to access peripheral devices like disks and network cards. The CPU can also switch itself from one running program to another.

In user mode, access to memory is limited to only some memory locations, and access to peripheral devices is denied. The ability to keep or relinquish the CPU is removed, and the CPU can be taken away from a program at any time. 

##5. What is the difference between an interrupt and a trap? 
A trap is an exception in a user process. It's caused by division by zero or invalid memory access. It's also the usual way to invoke a kernel routine because those run with a higher priority than user code. Handling is synchronous. 

An interrupt is something generated by the hardware. These are asynchronous that is  they don't happen at predictable places in the user code or "passive" since the interrupt handler has to wait for them to happen eventually.

##6.Give three examples of an interrupt. 
the three examples of an interrupt are:

Clock Interrupt : The currently running process has been executing for the maximum allowable time slice determined in the operating system. If it happens, then this process must be switched to a ready state and another process must be dispatched .
 
 I/O Interrupt : The operating system determines what I/O action has occurred
 
 key stroke: pressing a key on keyboard is n hardware interrupt that casue the process to read the keystroke.

##7.What is the difference between a mode switch and a process switch?
A mode switch may occur without changing the state of the process that is currently in the Running state where as a process switch involves taking the currently executing process out of the Running state in favor of another process. The process context switch involves saving more state information
